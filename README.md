# CS 710 - Advanced Data Visualization (Spring 2023) 
## Instructor: Lindsay D. Waldrop, Ph.D.

## Course Information 

This is the course information repository for Advanced Data Visualization. It will contain all lecture notes and other course documents needed to participate in the course during Spring 2023. This course will be primarily taught in R. We will use git and Github for version control and coding collaboration. 

## Installing git

git is a version-control software that we'll be using in the course. It interfaces with Github and will allow you to create, edit, and sync (push/pull) repositories. To download git, go here: https://git-scm.com/downloads and select your operating system. We'll be using git through both Bash command line and RStudio. 

## Installing RStudio 

RStudio is a useful wrapper for R that we'll use in the course. It talks to git, making version control a bit easier than working from only command line. 

- Download the latest version of R: https://cloud.r-project.org/ Select your operating system and download and run the package installer. 
- Download RStudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Select the free desktop version. Follow installation instructions. 
- After installing RStudio, make sure that git is working. Open RStudio and open Preferences. Under the left column, select "Git/SVN" and make sure the "Enable version control interace for RStudio projects" is checked. 

## Setting up git and RStudio

To initialize git, please download the RStudio-Github.Rmd in the Instructions folder.
